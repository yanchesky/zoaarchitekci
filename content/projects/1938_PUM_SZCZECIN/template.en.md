The area for the planned investment of a&nbsp;large facility with specialized purposes is special for several reasons. First of all, it is accessible only from Unii Lubelskiej street, through a&nbsp;large parking lot, which, in accordance with the terms of the competition, is intended to be kept. Secondly, on the north side it is adjacent to low single-family buildings. And, perhaps most importantly, it is entirely a basin for a never-realized stadium.

These conditions pose challenges related to the scale (inscribing it into the environment), accessibility, and relating to the specific topography.

And it was the existing topography that inspired us to design solutions that respond to the above-mentioned challenges.
