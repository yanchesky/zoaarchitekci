The existing complex of buildings of the Academy of Fine Arts, located in the post-industrial buildings of the former Municipal Sanitary Establishments, constitutes an "organism" with a&nbsp;characteristic principle of shaping the space. The site was surrounded by a&nbsp;brick wall, behind which "hidden" small courtyards and buildings were hidden. As a&nbsp;result, separate spaces were obtained, ensuring peace, perfectly suitable for annexation by artists.
