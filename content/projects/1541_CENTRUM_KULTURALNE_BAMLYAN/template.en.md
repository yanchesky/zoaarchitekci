Our intention for the building is to become part of the rich history of the Bamiyan and to create a clear sign of contemporary times. However, our perception assumes the present may not dominate the past. Therefore, we decided on a&nbsp;simple, clear form and limited ways of expression to the necessary minimum. We would like the building to draw from the vast tradition of this place, that is why we used the local stone as the main building material. We introduced elements inspired by tradition, both in the way we arranged the space (the inner court, rooms) and specific architectural solutions.
