The designed housing estate is a&nbsp;response to the aspirations of this part of society that dreams of affordable homes. The surface parameters of the houses correspond to the demand for the most popular areas in multi-family buildings. Houses of different sizes have been mixed so as not to create clusters of people with different financial resources or in different age groups. Much of the site has been designed as communal public spaces for integration.
