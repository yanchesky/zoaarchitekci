The main goal was to create a&nbsp;facility implementing a&nbsp;rich utility program imposed by the Investor, harmoniously fitting into the existing buildings and communication system and at the same time increasing the standard of the surrounding space, creating favorable conditions for users, patient-friendly, with a&nbsp;clear spatial layout, while optimizing the use of the area.

At the same time, the project takes into account the need to divide the investment into two stages in such a&nbsp;way that the facility will function in a reduced form after the implementation of the first stage, without the need to reorganize after expansion.
