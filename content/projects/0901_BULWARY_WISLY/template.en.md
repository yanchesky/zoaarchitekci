The project decided to organically connect the Vistula boulevard with the city, enabling free, collision-free communication between the Old Town, Podzamcze and Powiśle. Additionally, an attractive development of the river bank was provided as a magnet for residents and tourists. The project assumes the adaptation of the existing underground passages in the Podzamcze area, the construction of an additional passage under the Wisłostrada and an observation deck. In addition, new public transport stops were located on the Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge and the location of a&nbsp;pedestrian crossing at the exit of ul. Nowy Zjazd.
