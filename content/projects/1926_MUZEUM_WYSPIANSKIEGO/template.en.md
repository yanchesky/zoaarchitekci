The Stanisław Wyspiański Museum, located in the immediate vicinity of the National Museum, is a&nbsp;building dedicated to one artist, whose works must remain hidden behind its walls to protect it from daylight.

The building, in accordance with the intention of the Ordering Party, should, however, have features that will allow it to be identified with the author of the works presented in it, and the heart of the designed building is to be the exhibition of the monumental stained glass project God the Father.

Therefore, we decided that the most important building material should be light. Light as one of the guiding materials used by Wyspiański, light as a&nbsp;frame for individual elements or solids and as a&nbsp;"painter" of the entrance hall.
