The complex of multi-family buildings in the revitalized Żoliborz Przemysłowy district is characterized by large courtyards with high greenery and also high intensity of development. An important design assumption was to create an open estate enabling free pedestrian communication through the estate. Only the courtyards of individual quarters have been separated.
