The general principle of shaping the form of both buildings is the strip-like arrangement of the storeys. Expressive stripes of balcony slabs were cut with glass strips. These seemingly simple and calm elements are juxtaposed with an offset, each successive storey slides down from the storey below. In order to intensify the impression of dynamics, a&nbsp;different shift vector was used in each of the hotels, additionally directing them in opposite directions. The shafts of the buildings formed in this way were set on a&nbsp;solid 2-story base. In the basement zone, the base contains numerous glass openings, which favors building relations between the interior and its surroundings.
