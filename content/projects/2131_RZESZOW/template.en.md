The urban composition of the complex is based on a perpendicular arrangement of blocks, corresponding to the sides of the world, creating a characteristic orthogonal landscape of a large medical complex. The newly designed building was connected to this system through a lower, three-story part, which is a continuation both in terms of composition and functionally of the H2 building. The main, six-storey, block was based on the scheme of the letter H. The arms of the newly designed hospital continue the directions indicated by the existing facilities.
