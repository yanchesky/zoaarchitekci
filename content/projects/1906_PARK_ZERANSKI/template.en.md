Recognizing the existing natural and cultural values of the present Żerański Park, we want to limit our interference to the necessary infrastructure (pavements, bicycle paths, places of various activities) and emphasize the valuable and unique features of this place. The western part of the area is evidently dominated by nature. There is no human activity whatsoever. The eastern part is a&nbsp;construction industry waste dump, a kind of monument to the past. However, here too, nature decided to take control, absorbing, as it were, the waste left by man.
