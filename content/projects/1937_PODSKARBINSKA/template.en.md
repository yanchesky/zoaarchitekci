Residential complex, which is a&nbsp;continuation of the design thought about the subjectivity of the resident as a&nbsp;user of space and thus: vehicular communication takes place only outside the housing estate, individual quarters are separated by pedestrian walkways. We designed two squares in the housing estate, one in the vicinity of the housing estate club, the other next to the planned kindergarten.
