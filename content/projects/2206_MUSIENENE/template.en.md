The urban design project of the Musienene Special Economic Zone, located in the North Kivu Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The main objective of the project is to integrate this much-needed functional complex into challenging locational conditions (mountainous and marshy terrain) while respecting nature and the landscape.
