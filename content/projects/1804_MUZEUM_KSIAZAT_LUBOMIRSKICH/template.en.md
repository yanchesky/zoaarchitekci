The surrounding urban fabric was created in various cultural contexts, different periods of time and in various styles, however, despite its pluralistic context, it leaves a&nbsp;consistent image of the city.

The location of the designed building does not bear the hallmarks of a&nbsp;dominant feature, it is located in compact buildings and due to the way its architecture is perceived through specific perspectives and corners, it should be a tribute to treating the designed building as a&nbsp;complement to the complex of "walls" in the city's urban planning
