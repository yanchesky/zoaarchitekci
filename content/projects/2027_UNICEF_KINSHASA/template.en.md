The project of the UNDP / UNICEF headquarters involves the construction of two buildings embedded in a&nbsp;common base containing common rooms / multi-functional rooms, a&nbsp;canteen / and a&nbsp;garage. The architecture of the complex is conditioned by the climatic conditions - special emphasis was placed on protection against the sun in the form of shading ceiling slabs.
