The expansion and reconstruction of the facility was particularly demanding due to the high expectations of the city authorities in order to improve the quality of public space in the center of Szczecin. Our primary goal, apart from designing a friendly and effective shopping center, was to give the building the features of downtown development that interacted with the neighborhood.
