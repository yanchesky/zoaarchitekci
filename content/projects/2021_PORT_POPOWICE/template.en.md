The high-rise building is located at the closure of the Popowice Port dock. Wind and water live in symbiosis here. The changing nature of the elements directly related to the location are reflected in the proposed dynamic, emotional form of the building, shaped from calm and subdued elements of architecture, without unnecessary decorating, but allowing for the creation of a characteristic, memorable object, constituting a new, clear SIGN.
