One of the first residential complexes built in Służewiec Przemysłowy. The estate is designed as an unenclosed estate, with a&nbsp;large number of various courtyards and a&nbsp;park to provide residents with a&nbsp;wide range of recreational activities in the heart of a&nbsp;district with high development intensity and a&nbsp;very limited amount of green areas. Circular motion is brought outside.
