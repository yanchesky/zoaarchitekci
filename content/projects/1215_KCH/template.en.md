A complicated project of converting a&nbsp;makeshift building into a&nbsp;luxurious SPA center in the immediate vicinity of the historic graduation towers in Konstancin. It was equally important to respect the local context, requiring close cooperation with the conservator, as well as the Investor's expectations regarding the quality of architecture. The building, despite the fact that it looks like cozy pavilions scattered in the park, houses a hotel, swimming pool, fitness room and a&nbsp;full range of wellness rooms.
