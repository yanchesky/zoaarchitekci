A housing estate consisting of ten buildings is being developed in the dynamically growing part of Kamionek in Warsaw's Praga Po≈Çudnie district. The constructed buildings will form classic urban blocks with semi-private, green courtyards. The southern and western facades will feature large balconies, allowing residents to enjoy active relaxation during the summer months.
