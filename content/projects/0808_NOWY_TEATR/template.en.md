The building of the New Theater is organized around the inner courtyard, as well as along the adjoining streets: Madalińskiego, Sandomierska and Melsztyńska. Thanks to this, the space intended for theatrical activities does not lose its relationship with the environment, despite the fact that it is separated from the hustle and bustle of the city. The shell made of concrete walls of the newly designed buildings and the post-industrial facade of the hall provide an effective barrier against undesirable interference from the outside. At the same time, in accordance with the intention of the contracting authority, the open formula of the theater was kept. The key element is the dominant feature of the complex in the form of a&nbsp;transparent block, which houses educational spaces and rehearsal rooms. It is a place that captures the spirit of the theater, reveals the backstage of the creative process and invites you to the interior of the theater complex.
