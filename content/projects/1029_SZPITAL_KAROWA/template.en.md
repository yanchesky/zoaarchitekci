It was decided to use modern means of architectural expression as well as contemporary materials in order to clearly differentiate existing and planned objects, thanks to which the ability to read the historical elements of the composition was not lost. The use of glass with a certain degree of reflectivity as the outer skin of the newly designed cubatures allows to bring out the historic character of the existing fa√ßade while creating perfect conditions for acoustic insulation.
