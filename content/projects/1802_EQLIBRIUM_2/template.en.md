The building is located in Warsaw's Wola district, in the vicinity of the existing EQlibrium building. It fills the corner of ul. Jana Kazimierza and Wschowska, completing the service quarter of buildings. The building visually consists of two blocks. On the south side there is a&nbsp;lower part, and on the north side there is a higher block with slender proportions. The entire façade is made of glass, with a&nbsp;variable rhythm of windows, so as to provide future users with access to natural light in an optimal way.
