We decided to design a&nbsp;stylistically coherent urban layout, where public spaces are delimited by public buildings with frontage architecture, remaining in dialogue with the neighborhood. All new volumes are about 15 m high so as not to dominate the buildings along Konwiktorska Street and, above all, the Traugutt Park. All buildings are made of the same solid material, which is concrete. Thanks to these decisions and the "sliding" of the roof above the existing building towards the (intended for preservation) turf, the existing grandstand with the accompanying facilities of the swimming pool and sports hall again became the "main player" of the establishment.
