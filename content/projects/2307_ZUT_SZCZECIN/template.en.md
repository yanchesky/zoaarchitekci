Due to the proximity of extensive development and aÂ complex of dense greenery, we decided to incorporate the building into the landscape by limiting its height to three stories (from the west and partially from the north) and four stories (on the southern and eastern sides) where the ground level is lower.
Modularity, rhythm, repeatability, and clear construction seemed exceptionally important to us considering the function of the facility. We wanted the computer science department to be an easily interpretable piece of engineering art for the users, logical, leaving no questions unanswered. Visible columns, beams, floor slabs, and trusses clearly tell the story of how the building is constructed.
