Analyzing all the possibilities arising from available technological, material, and structural solutions that, in a sense, create an unlimited field of design solutions, we have concluded that the archetypal form of the Lusatian hut, characteristic of our geographical region and represented in the reconstructed defensive settlement on the peninsula, remains a timeless and universal form both in its formal and functional aspects. Furthermore, the materials used in its construction at that time continue to be the most environmentally friendly materials for us. Therefore, any attempt to operate with the current available possibilities by competing with reconstruction through extravagant forms or using materials unnatural to the region would be out of place. On the other hand, imitation by merely transferring historical formal or material solutions easily would verge on caricature and would contradict the rightful assumptions of the Ordering Party, requiring the designer to plan a structure that is a testament to our times. This argument has also deterred us from considering a 'hidden' or 'concealed' structure.

Hence, our idea for the exhibition pavilion is based on utilizing the most common, archetypal, economical, well-known, and friendly form of a house with a gable roof, while simultaneously employing local traditional building materials such as wood, earth, and clay. The testament of the time in which the pavilion will be constructed lies in how we utilize this form and these materials.
