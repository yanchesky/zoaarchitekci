An ambitious urban project of the new Takoradi district, a&nbsp;city located on the Gulf of Guinea. It is an attempt to respond to the growing demand for good quality urban space in West Africa. The basic problems were to face the local conditions concerning the use of the natural environment and an attempt to use greenery as a natural protection against climatic conditions.
