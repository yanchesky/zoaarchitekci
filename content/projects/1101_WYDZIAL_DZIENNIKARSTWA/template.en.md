It was decided to clearly distinguish the historic elements of the building from the newly designed ones. For this purpose, the facades and the internal walls that were left were renovated in a way that makes it possible to recognize the time-honoured elements. The historic stairs, furniture and doors have been used and displayed. New construction and finishing elements have been selected so as not to compete with historic elements.
