The rich functional program, which includes, among others, three swimming pools (aquapark, outdoor swimming pool and a&nbsp;swimming pool on the roof), a&nbsp;wellness complex, two restaurants and drink bars has been composed in such a&nbsp;way as to make the most of the plot. Architecture refers to the tradition of seaside hotel facilities.
